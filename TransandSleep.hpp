// Trans simulates processing a transaction
// It does not simulate this by using sleep -- that would free up the CPU.
// Thus, Trans does a silly computation to use up CPU cycles. Note that the 
// computation has to produce some result. If it doesn't, then a smart 
// compiler will notice this and delete (optimize) the code!

// The loop's computation (to waste time) is used to modify TransSave.
// TransSave is added to the wait time in Sleep -- a few billionths of a
// second. By doing this, something "real" comes from the computation, and
// the compiler is fooled.

void Trans( int n );


// Sleep simulates pauses between transactions
// Parameter given expresses wait time in hundreds of a nanosecond.

void Sleep( int n );
